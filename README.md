# Fleet Management System with Traffic Negotiation for Multi-Robots

## Overview

The Fleet Management System is a simulation of a fleet of robots that perform tasks based on priority while moving along a network of nodes. The system includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that visualizes the robots' movements and task completions. It also incorporates logging for robot actions, path choices, waiting conditions, and task completions.
